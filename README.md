Applying predictive analytics on student data to predict the likelihood of the student being recruited by an employer on campus

The dataset contains student data from an Institute's MBA program with features such as the overall score in the 10th and 12th grades , undergraduate degree and GPA in percentage and so on.

A multi-layer perceptron has been developed using the keras API on Tensorflow to classify whether a student is placed by a company visiting
on campus. The computation has been performed on GPU to take on the load of multiple epochs in the training process if needed.

The project is still under development and the final results will give a better picture of what factors really determine the successful 
recruitment of a student and the expectation of employers visiting the university.
